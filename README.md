## Overview

Zero-shot reasoning allows models to make inferences without prior examples. This repository provides structured output for visual zero-shot reasoning using the Ollama framework. By leveraging large language models (LLMs), we create a backend and frontend system that supports both chain-of-thought and graph-of-thought reasoning. This project aims to simplify complex reasoning tasks and enhance the capabilities of AI in understanding visual inputs.

## Features

- **Backend Support**: Built with FastAPI and Uvicorn for efficient processing.
- **Frontend Visualization**: Utilizes Vis.js for interactive data visualization.
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Supports multi-step reasoning processes.
- **Graph-of-Thoughts**: Implements a graphical representation of reasoning paths.
- **Large Language Models**: Integrates state-of-the-art LLMs for enhanced reasoning capabilities.
- **Zero-Shot Learning**: Allows models to perform tasks without specific training examples.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahta14/zeroshot-reasoning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd zeroshot-reasoning
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the frontend.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the zero-shot reasoning capabilities. Here’s how:

1. **Access the API**: Use the provided endpoints to submit visual inputs for reasoning.
2. **Visualize Results**: The frontend will display reasoning paths and outputs using Vis.js.
3. **Experiment**: Try different visual inputs to see how the model responds without prior training.
